# Introduction

In the future, robots will perceive the environment as we do, communicate with us through natural language and help us with our tasks. LEGENT is dedicated to developing robots that can chat, see, and act from virtual worlds to the real world. Designed to integrate large models with embodied agents, this platform prioritizes ease of use and scalability, focusing on developing:

1. An easy-to-use environment that simulates a physical world, where an agent can interact with humans through language, receive egocentric vision, and perform physical actions.

2. Automated generation of training data, including the generation of scenes, tasks, and agent trajectories. The platform is tailored to train large multimodal models as embodied models, using generated data from simulated worlds at scale. LEGENT serves as the data engine for embodied models in robotics and games, as well as for world models.

!!! warning "Important Note"
    
    LEGENT is currently organizing code and documents, as well as carrying out necessary bug fixes and improvements to existing features. It will be more convenient to use once this process is complete. If you want a more stable version, please stay tuned!

!!! Note
    
    LEGENT is in the early stages of development, so issues and shortcomings are inevitable. We appreciate your constructive feedback and will address problems as quickly as possible.
