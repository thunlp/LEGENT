# Instructions for LEGENT web demo (Alpha Version)

#### How to play

Move the mouse: Rotate the perspective.

W, A, S, D: Move the character.

G or left mouse button: Grab, release, open, or close an object.

I, K or J, L or U, O: Rotate a held object in three dimensions. (experimental)

Enter: Open the chatbox to chat.

#### Chat

Type anything into the chat box and press enter to send. The agent's control sequence will be displayed in the upper left corner (press T to hide)

#### Simple Control

Send "move_forward(1.2)" to make the agent move forward 1.2m.
Send "rotate_right(30)" to make the agent rotate right 30 degrees.

#### Generate a new scene

Send "#RESET" in the chatbox to generate a new scene.

#### Important notes

1. The web demo has much poorer physics and lower frame rates compared to the desktop versions, which may cause some flawed physical behaviors.
2. The current scene generation is from an old version with very limited objects. A better version will be released soon.
3. The chat ability is still very primitive and the agent will make errors. We are developing it.
4. The web demo only showcases a small portion of the platform's functionality. It uses stylized rendering and low-poly object assets instead of realistic ones. For more features, please refer to the platform's documentation.
